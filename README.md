# BLINKIT-PROJECT
1. 📌 Project Title
BlinkIT Grocery Sales Performance & Outlet Analysis

2. 📝 Short Description
This Power BI project presents a comprehensive business intelligence dashboard for BlinkIT, a quick-commerce grocery delivery company. The aim is to uncover actionable insights from historical sales, product categories, and outlet-level performance. The dashboard is designed to support marketing, operations, and strategic planning teams by identifying high-performing outlets, sales trends, and product category preferences based on customer behavior.

3. 🛠️ Tech Stack
Power BI Desktop – Dashboard development, data visualization, and DAX measures

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Custom KPI calculations and slicers

Power Query (M Language) – Data transformation and cleansing

Excel/CSV – Original data source format

Star Schema Design – Efficient data modeling with fact and dimension tables

4. 📂 Data Source
The project uses a pre-cleaned dataset representing BlinkIT’s historical grocery transactions. It includes:

Sales data: Item-wise transaction records

Product attributes: Fat content, visibility, item type

Outlet information: Outlet size, type, location tier, year of establishment

Customer feedback: Ratings and sales volume metrics

The source was ingested via Excel/CSV format and modeled in Power BI using one fact table (BlinkIT Grocery Data) and related dimension tables for filtering and KPIs.

5. ✨ Features & Highlights
🔹 A. Executive KPIs & Sales Summary
At the top of the dashboard, key performance indicators (KPIs) such as, Total Sales ($1.2M), Average Sales per item (~$141), Total Items Sold (8,523), and Average Rating (~3.9) offer a snapshot of BlinkIT’s performance.

Example: The dashboard reveals that newer outlets opened after 2020 contributed significantly to total revenue, indicating strong early traction.

🔹 B. Outlet-Level Insights
The report dives deep into outlet performance by size, location tier, and type:

Tier-3 locations lead in sales (~$306K), outperforming Tier 1 and 2 cities.

Medium-sized stores generate the highest profitability.

Supermarkets drive more revenue, while grocery stores offer better product visibility.

Example: In Tier-3 regions, medium-sized stores outperformed others, making a strong case for expanding this format in similar markets.

🔹 C. Product Category & Consumer Trends
The visualizations show a clear preference for low-fat products, making up 60–64% of total sales. Additionally, fruits, vegetables, and snacks dominate item-type sales.

Example: Low-fat products dominate sales, suggesting BlinkIT’s customers prioritize healthy eating—an insight useful for inventory planning and marketing.

🔹 D. Data Modeling & Slicing
The report uses a star schema model to allow seamless slicing and dicing of data. Filters and slicers allow analysis by:

Item type
Outlet type
Fat content
Establishment year

Example: Users can filter the report by outlet year to see how sales grow over time and by outlet type to compare profitability across business formats.

🔹 E. Actionable Business Insights
The dashboard is not just visual—it tells a story:

Tier-3 expansion is a viable growth strategy.

Product mix (favoring low-fat and fresh produce) should be prioritized.

Outlet formats need balancing between visibility (grocery stores) and volume (supermarkets).

Example: High-performing grocery stores may benefit from better layout and promotion strategies to close the revenue gap with supermarkets.
